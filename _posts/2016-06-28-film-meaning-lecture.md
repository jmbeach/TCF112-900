# Module 9
## Theme, Meaning, and Sub-Text

+ Audio 0:00:41.954095

### A question of form

  + You should be able to tell people now, what was actually good or bad about a movie

### What about meaning?
+ What actually happens - manifest meaning
+ Ex: What is Citizen Kane about?
  + Explicit: About a rich guy. Says something about a sled
  + Implicit: About how money and power can destroy who you really are.
+ Audio 0:02:52.003711

### Latent, implicit meaning
+ Not just the plot, characters, or how you feel
+ Draws parallels to your world

### Where do implicit meanings come from?
+ One idea is that the filmmakers put them there purposefully
  + Audio 0:03:59.374658
  + The majority of films in all categories are the unconscious instruments of the ideology that produces them
    + Ex: Citizen Kane
      + What the hell? Why bird?
      + Is there a symbolic, implicit meaning to the bird?
        + The director says that this is to wake up the audience
+ Director David Lynch
  + Audio 0:06:43.699258
  + Some directors don't want to tell the viewers how to feel
+ Audio 0:07:17.732309
+ Ex: Girls Can't Help It
  + The implicit meaning is that women are just objects that men look at
    + That's just something men will do
    + This is likely not the message that they intended to convey
+ Audio 0:08:24.260226
  + The norms and the ideology of a movie affect how we interpret it

### History of Violence
+ Audio 0:09:18.019582
+ Over the course of the film, it is revealed that he has a violent past, but it's unclear whether his family can accept him now
+ Audio 0:10:02.671849

### Munich
+ Abner has to kill terrorists
  + Contaminated by the Violence

+ Both Munich and History of Violence are asking the same questions. You don't have to have been alive during 9/11 to understand the message behind History of Violence.

### Viewers Create Meaning
+ Audio 0:11:51.858058
+ Your experience also adds to the meaning of the film
+ Are all meanings acceptable then?
  + Not really
  + You just side with whatever ideas make sense to you
+ Rather than trying to focus on one "true meaning", examine the overarching meanings of the movie

### The Searchers
+ Audio 0:15:13.759368
+ Ask yourself
+ Who is the Hero?
  + What characteristics does he have?
