+ Creepy music

## A new way of watching motion pictures
+ Audio 0:01:48.407700
+ We'll try to watch films in a different way in this module
+ Filmmakers experiment with length of films
+ Audio 0:02:15.808262
+ How do we experience films?
+ How do we express ourselves with films?
+ Audio 0:02:38.445118
+ How do people learn to understand film "languages?"
  + A mistaken belief would be that we automatically know how to understand a film effortlessly

+ Audio 0:03:41.845108
+ We have a formulaic look at how movies are supposed to go
+ What if the plot never came?
+ What if there are no characters to identify with?
+ Most viewers expect any deviation from plot to be temporary
+ Audio 0:04:53.905823
+ Step 1
  + Don't spend the whole time waiting for the film to normalize
  + See it in a historical context
+ Audio 0:05:44.406367
+ Block of color example
  + You have to think about what film was like at that time?
  + Make an effort to empathize with the filmmaker
+ Audio 0:07:30.700827
+ You might look at film as a way to easily sway people
+ You can purposely frustrate people by foiling their expectations through film
+ Audio 0:08:31.281676
+ Some experimental film just wants to have fun or see what they can do
+ Audio 0:08:57.324599
+ Some experimental film gets put into more digestable movies and reaches a lot of people in a novel way

+ Audio 0:10:28.864038
+ Most films we watch immerse us in a fictional world and get us to identify with its characters
+ Audio 0:10:59.438945
+ Stellar
+ The pictures are very jarring and mostly color and texture
+ There is no form or shape in the pictures to latch onto to make sense of what you are seeing.
+ Can't help but think it would be an awesome music video
+ Audio 0:13:08.993543
+ There's no characters and no story in stellar
+ You could appreciate it on a purely aesthetic level
  + Look at it like a sunset
+ Most experimental films have characters and they are doing things and time passes, but nothing is really consequential
  + In short, filmmakers are just experimenting
