## Module 1: Understanding Form, Content, and Meaning

+ Turning off auto-pilot
	+ We like to get sucked in by movies
		+ For this course, we need to fight against this and focus on specific elements of a film

+ There are many different ways to talk about film

## Elements we'll discuss

+ Form vs. Content

## Content

+ The information being conveyed
+ The story

## Form

+ The manor in which a story is conveyed

### Examples

+ Father dies, seaks revenge
	+ Hamlet
	+ Lion King
	+ Roughly the same form and diologue, but the form is diferent

## Content example

+ Son of wealthy man witnesses murder of parents and grows up to become a vigilante to stop crime in his city
	+ Batman has been told many ways
	+ Audio 0:04:44.064035

## Differences of form

+ Acting
+ Etc

## Formal Analysis Exercise 1: Cutting on the Action
+ Audio 0:06:38.725237
+ Real life doesn't change perspective, but film does it all the time
+ Film wants you to forget that you're not actually experiencing this
	+ However, cutting is not at all like real life
	+ The continuity of action prevents you from questioning it
	+ The audio also forms a bridge over the cuts
+ Cutting in an action sequence
	+ Audio 0:09:54.331215
		+ Happens a lot
		+ The Born Supremacy has a ton of cuts
		+ "Good" editing
			+ Depends on the norm

## Line of action
+ Cutting back and forth between two parallel events (with
	their own cuts)
	+ Audio 0:13:30.444957
	+ Look at Star Wars: A New Hope (1977)
		+ Watch for lines of action in different locations
		+ A: the scene in the trash compactor
		+ B: the scene with the droids and clones
			+ While in scene B, you are acutely aware that our heroes
			are going to be crushed in scene A
				+ Will c3p0 shut down the garbage compactor in time?

## Pace of the editing
+ The pace in the Star Wars scene speeds up as the tension builds
