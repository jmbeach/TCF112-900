# Module 3

+ Film could have been used for anything
  + For a variety of reasons
      + Film production quickly became standardized primarily to tell fictional stories

## Storytelling

+ Humans have been telling stories forever

## Mise en Scene

+ What's in the frame

## Cinematography

+ tell a story

+ How do we know what to put in the frame
  + How do you depict the frame?
    + Close up?
    + Far away?
  + As realistic as possible?
    + Or fantastic

## Mise en Scene

+ What setting do we choose?
  + Obvious answer: Something pleasing
  + Another answer
    + Novel or unusual settings
+ What if the goal is to increase the sense that what they are seeing is real?
  + Then the pleasingness of the environment doesn't matter as much
  + A set that mimics the settings that the characters would inhabit would be best
+ Ex: Scene from Forest Gump
  + Audio 0:06:40.866999
+ Where to film?
  + On location?
  + Simulated?
+ Before the invention of sound in film, extraneous sounds were not a problem, but later it would be a big one
  + Audio 0:07:54.625824
+ Studio shooting became common practice eventually

+ Filmmakers in the US incorporated on location filming in the 60s
+ Eventually using computers has become increasing Popular

+ How do we show the action?
+ Objective view shot
  + Shows what's going on primarily
+ Subjective
  + Through the eyes of one of the characters
  + Audio 0:09:32.552096
  + (POV) point-of-view shot
    + We only know it's a POV shot in combination with an objective shot
    + Lets us participate in the film
+ How far away from the characters do we want to be?
  + Audio 0:10:30.006817
  + Filmmakers often use close-ups of characters to let us know what they are thinking
  + Close-ups can also be used to draw attention to an important object
  + Useful way to draw attention
  + Medium shot
    + Best of both worlds
  + Long shots
    + Ideal for showing the larger spacial areas where actions take place
      + Helps orient people to the scene before the scene really begins
      + Audio 0:12:37.770917
    + Can convey isolation or other feelings
    + Can also be used to show scale
+ Depth of field
  + The extent to which the viewer perceives the scene to have depth
  + In order to make the images on the screen come to life, it helps to create the illusion of depth
  + Putting things in the foreground, mid-ground, and background help create the illusion of depth-of-field
+ Level of camera
  + Eye Level
    + most common
  + Low angle
    + Can show the object to be powerful
  + High angle
    + Can show powerlessness
  + Audio 0:15:25.139726

## Cinematography
+ Color
  + In the 1940's and 50's, they used technicolor
    + Didn't look very real
  + Eastmancolor 1950's - 2000's
    + Film is an art and a business
      + Low costs will prevail
      + Audio 0:17:44.219855
    + Film is not just trying to re-create reality
+ Movement
  + Camera and people
  + camera
    + panning
    + Tilting
      + Both can be used to mimic a person's head bobbing while moving
    + Tracking shots
      + When the whole camera actually moves
      + Can provide more visual information and depth of field.
    + Overly-complex camera movements can feel unreal to viewers
      + The filmmaker has to find a balance
      + Audio 0:20:43.078934
+ Citizen Kane (1941)
  + Influenced visual and narrative form of subsequent films
  + Pay attention to:
    + Order of events as presented in film's plot/syuzet
    + From who's perspective we get information
    + The way lighting is used
    + Depth of field
    + Audio 0:21:49.554470
