# Editing
+ Audio 0:01:10.093549
+ Close up

+ 1910 - 1900
+ (Russian guy) figured out how to use editing to use editing to evoke emotion
+ The Kuleshov Effect
  + People perceive a different emotion from an actor's face (even the same face) depending on what happened right before
  + Audio 0:03:03.708193

## Linguistic Analogy
+ Two words
  + Person
  + Car
  + EX:
    + car person is different from person car
    + car hits person
    + person hits car

+ Following up a shot with faces
  + We can see emotion on actors' faces that we might not have been able to perceive
    + Audio 0:04:43.521021
  + The physical space that the characters inhabit don't even have to be the same or even the same day
  + Audio 0:05:16.120241

## Mrs. Bares 4th Grade Movie (1989)
+ How does editing create a sense of space in the viewer's mind
+ When does it not work?

+ Kid in pharmacy
  + Audio 0:06:12.200216
  + Harsh cut from kid picking up rocks to putting them down somewhere else
  + The dimming of the lights almost worked to make the stuff disapear
    + Audio 0:07:17.172563
    + The cut in from the left was jarring
  + Shots from above and below for no apparent reason
  + Actions happening more than once
  + Audio 0:08:24.610822
  + Some shots don't even look like their in the same room

+ Most modern film never breaks continuity
  + Helps immersion
  + Audio 0:10:34.269867

+ Filmmakers learned that they can put the viewer anywhere in relation to what's happening and the characters
  + Audio 0:11:29.307681
+ In modern film, you lose yourself

## Continuity Editing
+ There are some editing choices that purposefully break continuity
  + Audio 0:12:46.317721
  + Soviet filmmakers learned the power of juxtaposing images
    + This peaked between 1919 and 1929
      + Stopped because
        + Introduction of sound to movies
        + Stopped being about what message the movie communicated
+ Montages
  + Citizen Kane
    + Dramas, comedies, documentaries, etc
    + Sum up action over long periods of time
    + Audio 0:15:22.832436
  + Different from very short scenes
    + Uses music as a bridge

## Shot choice and editing scheme is usually determined before production

+ What choices does the editor make?
+ Audio 0:16:36.052360
  + Walter Murch
+ Needs a sense of rythem
  + Like a joke
    + If you tell a joke with bad rythm, the joke falls flat
    + It's like dance
      + You have to dance to learn to dance
+ Audio 0:17:57.116818
  + Editor has large control of time
    + Chooses when to cut to another shot
  + Pacing of film could talk about the length of time of the plot or the speed of cuts
    + You can have slow plot pace, with fast editing pace
    + Audio 0:19:50.480456
    + The average shot length has dropped dramatically

## Why are shots getting shorter?
+ Audio 0:21:15.481498
+ Increasing reliance on certain types of shots might be to blame
  + OTS
    + over-the-shoulder
    + has increased in frequency dramatically
    + has decreased in duration
+ Audio 0:22:40.346554
  + Ex: POV edit
  + What are they looking at?
  + Oh that's what they're looking at
    + In some ways, we are identifying with the camera
    + What perspective do we take?
      + Are we more likely to take a male's or female's perspective?
        + Not the same as asking are there more men than women in film
  + Filmmakers don't show us an even mix of men and women
    + There is a tendency of filmmakers to show us women from the perspective of a heterosexual man in a POV shot
      + This is not all shots in film of course
      + Audio 0:25:59.224757
      + Women are often shown just to look good
      + There is a preference to show things from the point of view of a heterosexual man
        + Maybe it is because many of filmmakers have been just that
        + Or maybe it's because most of the audience is
        + Audio 0:27:18.556558
  + The act of observing seems innocent
    + Maybe not
      + Especially when the observer can't look back
    + Alfred Hitchcock was good at making people feel uneasy with editing
    + Audio 0:29:05.841157
